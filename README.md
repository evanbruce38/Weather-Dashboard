  ## Description
  
  * This projects is another challenge I have created for bootcamp through the Uniersity of Miami coding bootcamp. This challenge included no starter code and was created entirely from scratch. The goal for this project is to create a website that allows a user to easily check the wearther forecast for a city. This website then displays the city and it's current conditions for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index, as well as the five day future forecast. The cities are then saved as recent search history for easy access in checking multiple locations.
